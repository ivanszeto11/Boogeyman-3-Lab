# Boogeyman 3 Lab

## Summary

This is the third lab in a series of challenge rooms from TryHackMe. The Boogeyman threat group struck again, but this time they were able to compromise the CEO's workstation! Using the Elastic SIEM solution, my task is to investigate this attack, much like an SOC analyst would. 

### Skills Learned

- Investigating an attack using log analysis in the Elastic SIEM  
- Identifying the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat group  
- Familiarity with filters in Elastic
